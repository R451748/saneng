This position is one in which the sex is done by penetrating from the front or from the behind while standing. Among all the sex positions in the class of standing posture, this occupies the highest place in the intensity of sexual desire. In this position, the woman stands erect and spreads her legs, and the man begins to enter her from the front or from the behind. For penetration from the behind, initially the woman stands erect, and from near the waist bends a bit forward, so that the buttocks spread outwards, and bending her knees she bends down, in this process she takes out her buttocks outwards, and due to this the cunt is partly seen. Thereafter, the man performs penetration. During the sexual game in this position, the man can hold the hands or the waist of the woman and can increase the speed of his thursts. This position offers both the partners the scope to access the other's body better. There is only one drawback of this position, in that it makes the secret organs of both the partners fall in line naturally...If people so wish, they can make some modification in the base posture of this position.
