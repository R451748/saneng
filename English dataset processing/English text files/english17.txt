The emission temperature of infrared radiation depends on the intensity, from the upper layers of the atmosphere longwave radiation is emitted, and from the lower layers, this is less. Most of the radiation emitted from the upper layers goes into the space, whereas the radiation from the lower layers enters the atmosphere again and gets absorbed by it. In this way, the green house effect depends on the rate of decrease of temperature with the height. If the temperature decrease rate is less green house effect is less and vice versa. Theories and models both indicate that due to the worming effect, the decrease in temperature as we go up is reduced. A negative lapse rate feedback is produced and this makes the green house effect weak. Calculation of the rate of change of temperature with height is very subtle and sensitive to tiny changes, and so it is very difficult to find out whether the model represents the reality or not.
